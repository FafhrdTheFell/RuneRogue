# RuneRogue #
Daring adventurers seek power and enlightenment in the Rune Master's abandoned palace. Their goal is to sit upon the Rune Throne on level 14 and be imbued with the power of a Rune Lord. None have yet succeeded.

Will the Rune Master's monstrous lackeys and rival Rune Lord aspirants block your way, as they have all who have preceded you?

## Adventurers

 The statistics panel on the right shows your statistics and health as well as the health of all monsters that you can see. You have six attributes:

*  You begin with 30 **Health** and a maximum of 30 **Health**. 

  Taking damage reduces your health, and some terrible monsters can even drain your life energies, reducing your maximum health. Resting does *not* cause you to regain health, but eating food in a market or reading self-help guides to being healthy in a book store can replenish your health and increase your maximum health.

* **Attack skill** increases your chance of hitting in melee combat, while **Weaponry** determines whether your hit will penetrate your target's armor, and if so, how much damage you do.

  You can increase your attack skill by reading self-help texts about attacking in book stores. You can increase your weaponry by shopping for weapons in a market.

*  **Defense skill** reduces your chance of being hit in melee combat. Your chance of being hit by a ranged attack is not affected however. **Armor** reduces the damage you take on a hit, and stout armor will reduce the damage to 0.

## Runes

If you are lucky you will come across a rune forge. At a forge you can purchase orichalcum and smith it into a physical rune imbued with magical energy. There are many runes and each provides a special power.

Be careful using your runes though. Since you are not a Rune Lord yet, your magic is imperfect, and when you use a rune, there is a chance it will disintegrate into dust.

There are 9 runes:

* The Rune of **Life** will resurrect you if you die.
* The Rune of **Death** will create a poison cloud to bring death to mortal foes.
* The Rune of **Thought** will show you the thoughts of nearby mortal foes. Sensing your opponent's thoughts also helps you attack and defend in melee combat.
* The Rune of **Darkness** hides you from nearby foes, although you are not totally invisible. When you attack from an unexpected location, your critical strikes can be deadly.
* The Rune of **Elements** produces a ray of elemental energies which will often destroy all monsters hit by the ray.
* The Rune of **Time** makes your actions quicker.
* The Rune of **Iron** shoots a razor-sharp spear of iron at a target. It can pass through monsters it damages to hit monsters beyond the first monster.
* The Rune of **Magic** helps you control your other runes. If you have a Rune of Magic and a rune you were using would disintegrate, the Rune of Magic will disintegrate instead.
* The Rune of the **Ram** causes you to charge through enemies, knocking them back and running past them as you attack all foes in your path.

## Key Bindings and Mouse Controls

**Movement Keys:** WASD, HJKL-YU-BN, arrow keys, and Numpad all move you. Pressing shift at the same time as a movement key will move you as far as possible in the direction chosen.

**Action Keys:** 'g' picks up an item from your spot, '>' descends a downwards stairway, and 'c' closes adjacent open doors.

**Quick Action Keys:** 1 collects the nearest item on the ground, 2 opens the nearest closed door, 3 moves to the nearest unexplored tile, and 't' allows you to target a square to auto-travel towards.

**Targeting Keys:** When choosing a target, you can select the target by your moving the aim square using movement keys, or Tab will cycle through available targets. X or Esc cancels the targeting.

**Mouse:** Left clicking on a square auto-travels you towards that square. Likewise in targeting mode, double-clicking on a square targets that square.

## Sources and Inspiration

I developed RuneRogue starting from the complete code of the RogueSharp v3.0 RLNet Tutorials  ([Creating a Roguelike Game in C#](https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/)). Those tutorials, the RogueSharp library, and RLNet, are all excellent and absent them this game would not exist.

RuneRogue is loosely inspired by [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (develz.org)](https://crawl.develz.org/). Discussions on the subreddit [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) and [Temple of The Roguelike](https://blog.roguetemple.com/) were also useful.
